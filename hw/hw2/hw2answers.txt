1. I used "mkdir 'hw1_copy'" to create a directory of all copied files of hw1.
2. Yes. DFS can be used to solve shortest path and distance user. It is effectively the same algorithm besides the way it travels down the tree/graph. It would also be less effecient as it goes to the deepest aspect first then returns to find the next deepest.
3. Yes. BFS can be used to solve as it will go through the users at a certain depth and keep track of visited.
4. You do not need to use DFS or BFS here as you can iterate through the friend ids of a friend of the root user to find any mutuals.
5. O(n+m)
6. O(n+m)
7. With the help of Drahmann Center tutoring this has taken me upwards of 10 hours.
